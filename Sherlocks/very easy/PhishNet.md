# **PhishNet**

**1)** We want to download the PhishNet.zip file from the HTB website & extract the file (password is "hacktheblue")...obviously ðŸ˜„

**2)** Once we have downloaded and extracted the file we should see an email file (.eml)

**3)** I recommend opening the file with both a text editor like notepad/notepad++ (if on windows) OR nano/vi/pluma/etc. (if on linux)

**4)** Now that we have the email opened in a text editor we can complete the first task: "**_"What is the originating IP address of the sender?"_**
Look for the line that says: X-Originating-IP:

**_answer: 45.67.89.10_**

**5)** Next **_"Which mail server relayed this email before reaching the victim?"_** If we look in the file we will see 3 lines with 3 IP's

....So how do we know which one is the right one? well we can guess and check because HTB is forgiving with wrong answers. BUT if this were a test, OR if its an interview question/ real life Incident Response how would we know? the best way to determine is look at the last hop...aka the last IP in the chain. aka 10:15:10 was the last one sent, and the IP associated to that is 203.0.113.25 so...

**_answer: 203.0.113.25_**
